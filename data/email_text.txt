Hi {source},


Welcome to InDigital's {year} Secret Santa Gift Exchange!

Please ignore the previous email, a reindeer must have sat on my keyboard multiple times.

Here is the person you have been given to buy a gift for this Christmas:

{target}.

I suggest you spend between £10 and £15 on your gift.

We'll be sharing our gifts on Friday the 17th of December at the Christmas Meal, so please make sure to bring your gift with you!

Have fun!


Santa
